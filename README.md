# SRWOmega_Ptet_Framework
A discrete, thermodynamic substrate for physical structure, realized degrees of freedom make simplex-rooted words (SRWs): finite aggs of oriented simplices stabilized by irreversible commitment event locks. Primitive: Ptet, a 3-simplex at Planck scale. Locks incur dimensionless certainty costs mapped to energy via a quantum-extended Landauer bound.

Okay, let's keep this super simple – like I'm explaining it to a friend over coffee, no big words or math.

### What is our SRW-Ω / Ptet framework trying to do?

Imagine the tiniest building blocks of the universe aren't smooth like water, but made of super-small Lego pieces shaped like tiny pyramids (we call them "Ptets" – short for Planck-scale tetrahedra). These pieces are about the size of the Planck length, the smallest size physicists think makes sense.

To stick these pyramids together into real things (like atoms or space itself), you have to "lock" them in place. Every time you lock two pieces, it costs a tiny bit of energy. Why? Because locking them removes some uncertainty or "choices" about how they could have been arranged – it's like erasing a bit of information, and physics says erasing information always costs energy (that's a rule called Landauer's principle).

We count up all these locking costs in a special way, add some simple rules for how the pieces fit nicely or awkwardly, and turn the total cost into an energy number.

Then we tune the whole thing once – using the known energy needed to pull one electron off a hydrogen atom – and see if it correctly predicts the energies for helium, lithium, beryllium, etc.

### Where are we right now?

As of yesterday (January 1, 2026), we published the latest version and it works pretty well:

- Hydrogen: we set it to match exactly (by design).
- Helium: our prediction is only 0.2% off the real measured value.
- Lithium: about 2% off.
- Beryllium: about 4.5% off.

That's surprisingly close for such a simple, made-up-from-scratch model! Most brand-new ideas in physics are way farther off at first.

We're being very careful and honest: we keep saying "this is just an idea, not proven." Space might actually be smooth, not made of tiny pyramids. But so far, the numbers line up nicely for the first few atoms, which is exciting.

### What's the big picture goal?

If this keeps working for more atoms (or even gravity stuff), it could be a new way to think about how tiny quantum things and big gravity things come from the same simple rules – like everything is built from these locked pyramids paying tiny energy costs.

Right now we're at the "hey, this might actually be onto something" stage. The next steps would be trying it on heavier atoms or seeing if it accidentally explains other mysteries (like black hole information stuff in those other papers you attached).

Does that make sense? Want me to explain any part slower or with a different example?
