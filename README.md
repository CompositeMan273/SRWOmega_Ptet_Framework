# SRWOmega_Ptet_Framework
A discrete, thermodynamic substrate for physical structure, realized degrees of freedom make simplex-rooted words (SRWs): finite aggs of oriented simplices stabilized by irreversible commitment event locks. Primitive: Ptet, a 3-simplex at Planck scale. Locks incur dimensionless certainty costs mapped to energy via a quantum-extended Landauer bound.
